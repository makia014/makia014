hey, I’m Ana

🌱 currently learning web-development via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and I'm enjoying it quite a lot 😊

⚡  fun fact: Star Trek sympathizer (*because of the cultural references and good humour*)

🖖🏻 favorite quotes:
 - Mr. Spock: "Change is the essential process of all existence." (*allusion to Heraclit's philosophy of change?*)
 - Lieutenant Worf: "Thinking about what you can't control only wastes energy, and creates its own enemy." (*allusion to the Stoic Dichotomy of Control?*)
 - Captain Jean-Luc Picard: "Things are only impossible until they are not." (*alussion to Nelson's Mandela quote on perseverance?*)
